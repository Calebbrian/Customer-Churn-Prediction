# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses a **Random Forest model** to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. It provides actionable insights to help businesses identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) using historical data.
- **Approach:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training with Random Forest.
- **Output:** Predictions on churn likelihood and key factors influencing churn.

## Files in Repository
- **Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb** — Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, analysis, and visualizations.
- **synthetic_telco_churn.xlsx** — Sample dataset used for training and testing.
- **Customer_Churn_Prediction_Stakeholder_Report.pdf** — Summary report for stakeholders with key findings and recommendations.
- **README.md** — Project documentation.

## Key Insights
- Certain features such as **tenure**, **monthly charges**, and **contract type** have strong influence on churn.
- Long-term contracts are associated with lower churn rates.
- Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Excel** for dataset exploration
